For decades, scientists have been trying to find cures for all the various cancers that plague humanity and have made incredible strides towards this goal. We currently have various treatments that are able to significantly prolong survival and in some cases completely treat the cancerous tumor. One of the major roadblocks in our ability to cure this disease is related to the incredible heterogeneity that exists within each tumor and each patient. Additionally, the way each organism responds to the tumor cells is also extremely varied placing a lot of pressure on clinicians and scientists to constantly adapt.\\

Research Spotlight **Research spotlight: Modeling motor neuron diseases in vitro** \\
\\
Motor neurons are important cells in our body that send signals to our skeletal muscle that allow us to do activities like walk, speak, swallow, and even breathe. Motor neuron diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) destroy motor neurons. When muscles don’t receive normal signals from our motor neurons, the muscles atrophy (weaken and shrink) and we lose the ability to do those activities over time.\\
